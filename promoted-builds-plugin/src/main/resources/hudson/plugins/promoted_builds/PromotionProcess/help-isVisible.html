	If you are using Inheritance Projects you can define promotions in base job. 
	You can then choose some of the promotion processes to be visible in some derived jobs but not others. 
	If parameter Visible evaluates to "true" or is empty, then it is visible, it is not visible otherwise. 
	You can also use parameters, e.g. ${PARAMETER_NAME} to reference other parameters. 
	Note that only default values of the parameters are evaluated, i.e. parameters of the jobs, not the builds are taken into account.	

    <p>
    

    <h3> Example configuration</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>BASE</b> job which configures promotion process <b>Promotion</b> and also has inheritable parameter <b>IsPromotionVisible</b>. 
    <b>Visible</b> property is set to reference <b>IsPromotionVisible</b>, i.e. its value is ${IsPromotionVisible}
    It also makes sense to hide this parameter from the build screen by selecting <b>Hide behind button on build screen?</b> checkbox in advanced parameter properties.  
    <li><b>DERIVEDEnabled</b> job which inherits from <b>BASE</b> but also references  <b>IsPromotionVisible</b> parameter and sets its default value to true.
	<li><b>DERIVEDDisabled</b> job which inherits from <b>BASE</b> but also references  <b>IsPromotionVisible</b> parameter and sets its default value to false.
	</ul>
	In this configuration <b>DERIVEDEnabled</b> will show promotion <b>Promotion</b> but <b>DERIVEDDisabled</b> will not show it.
