    <h2>Retrieve and modify promotion process definitions</h2>
    <p>
        GET <a href="../process/NAME/config.xml"><code>process/<i>NAME</i>/config.xml</code></a> to get the definition of an <em>active</em> process.
        POST to the same location to update it.
    </p>
    <h2>Create process definitions</h2>
    <p>
        POST to <a href="../createProcess?name=NAME"><code>createProcess?name=<i>NAME</i></code></a> to create a new process.
        You must pass its desired XML configuration as the body of the request.
        (Specify <code>Content-Type: application/xml</code>.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that newly created processes are not active.
        You need to then update the main projectâ€™s <code>config.xml</code> to add the new process to <code>JobPropertyImpl.activeProcessNames</code>.
    </p>
    <h2>Delete process definitions</h2>
    <p>
        POST to <a href="../process/NAME/doDelete"><code>process/<i>NAME</i>/doDelete</code></a> to delete the definition of a process.
