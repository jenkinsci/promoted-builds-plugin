    Promote a build as soon as a build is completed if the specified build parameter values match.
    This mechanism is convenient for associating small additional tasks at the end of the build.
    Compared to making it a part of the build, the difference is that this makes
    the additional step retryable, and a failure will not render the whole build as a failure.

    <p>
    This criteria can be also handy for consistency; say you have a lot of components built uniformly,
    and many of them have real test jobs hooked up as the downstream promotion criteria, but some of them
    might not have any. In such a case, you'll want to immediately promote it.
