    Designates that this promotion as requiring someone to go to the Hudson web UI
    and click the "approve promotion" button. This is useful when the promotion process
    is controlled by humans (such as by voting), or when you'd like to temporarily suspend
    promotion (such as when you are nearing a release.)
    <p>
    You can also optionally list user names or groups that are allowed to approve
    the promotion.  This list should be comma delimited.
