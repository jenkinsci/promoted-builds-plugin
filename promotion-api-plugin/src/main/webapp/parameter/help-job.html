    The implementation provides a support of multi-level addressing including special markups
    for the relative addressing. Effectively, the resolution order is following:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Optional</b> Legacy behavior, which existed till 2.22. 
          It is disabled by default. 
          If enabled and there is an item for the name on the top Jenkins level, it will be returned.
          <br/>
          Use <code>hudson.plugins.promoted_builds.util.ItemPathResolver.enableResolutionAgainstRoot</code> 
          Boolean system property to enable it.   
      <li>If the path starts with &quot;/&quot;, a global addressing will be used</li>
      <li>If the path starts with &quot;./&quot; or &quot;../&quot;, a relative addressing will be used</li>
      <li>If there is no prefix, a relative addressing will be tried. If it
          fails, the method falls back to a global one</li>
    </ul>
    For the relative and absolute addressing the engine supports &quot;.&quot; and
    &quot;..&quot; markers within the path.
    The first one points to the current element, the second one - to the upper element.
